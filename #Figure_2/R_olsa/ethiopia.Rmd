## Objective

This notebook replicates **Figure 4: Districts and Electricity Grid in Ethiopia**
from *Fried and Lagakos (2021)* as part of the take-home assignment on spatial
data visualization using vector data in economics.

---

## Data

- **District boundaries**: GADM (administrative level 2)
- **Electricity grid**: OpenStreetMap, extracted using Overpass Turbo

---

## Replication

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())

library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

setwd("/Users/olsaberani/Desktop/ethiopia_map")

# Load administrative districts
districts <- st_read("gadm/gadm41_ETH_2.shp")

# Load electricity transmission lines
grid_raw <- st_read("grid/ethiopia_power_lines.geojson")
```

```{r map, fig.width=7, fig.height=8, echo=FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(
    data = districts,
    fill = "grey85",
    color = "white",
    linewidth = 0.2
  ) +
  geom_sf(
    data = grid_raw,
    color = "red",
    linewidth = 0.6
  ) +
  theme_void() +
  labs(
    title = "Figure 4: Districts and Electricity Grid in Ethiopia",
    caption = "Districts: GADM (Level 2). Electricity grid: OpenStreetMap (Overpass Turbo). Replication of Fried and Lagakos (2021)."
  )
```
